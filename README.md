My introduction into the world of computer language... 
Some bullshit
On the real, none of you shitheads could possibly fathom the extremity of stupidity that is sweeping the nation. The smart-phone equips humans with more power than ever before to simplify critical thinking processes and growth theories into one-track minded episodes of derpitude. 
Take for example the popularity of the app Vine, or the increasingly acceptable narcissism that exists on nearly every personal social media profile. Or lack therof. It sucks. Ya feel?
